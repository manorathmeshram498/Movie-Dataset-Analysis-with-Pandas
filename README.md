## 🔍 Key Analyses Performed

- **Loaded the dataset** using Pandas for analysis.
- **Identified the movie with the highest box office earnings**, along with its title, genre, rating, and release year.
- **Calculated the average rating** of all movies in the dataset.
- **Computed the median release year** and determined the **most common genre**.
- **Filtered the dataset** to show only movies with a rating greater than 7.
- **Sorted the movies** by box office earnings in descending order and displayed the top 10 highest-grossing films.
- **Created a new column called `profitability`**, representing box office earnings divided by 100 million.
- **Grouped the data by genre** to calculate average ratings and average box office earnings per genre.
